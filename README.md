## Abstract
This report presents an analysis of kernelized linear classification. I implemented several machine learning algorithms from scratch, including the Perceptron, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) using the Pegasos algorithm, and Regularized Logistic Regression. I analysed the impact of polynomial feature expansion and kernel methods using Gaussian and polynomial kernels. The performance of each model was evaluated based on $\ell_{0-1}$ loss, variance and runtime.
